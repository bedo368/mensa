This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have configured environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.example` provided.
Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying files in the `app` directory or using static files in the `public` folder. Changes will auto-build.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load fonts like [Geist](https://vercel.com/font). Font display strategy and subsets have been configured for performance optimization.
